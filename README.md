# What makes a good wine?

### This project focuses on predicting the quality of a wine given a set of indicators
### The dataset comes from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielpanizzo/wine-quality
### I focused on data vizualisation, as well as using decision trees to predict the quality of the wine.
