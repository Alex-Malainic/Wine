# What makes a good wine?

## This project focuses on predicting the quality of a wine given a set of indicators
## The dataset comes from kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielpanizzo/wine-quality
## I focused on data vizualisation, as well as using decision trees and other algorithms to predict the quality of the wine.
## The project can be further improved to try other algorithms.
